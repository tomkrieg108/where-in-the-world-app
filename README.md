## Overview

Project was done using react (create-react-app) and tailwindcss

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*


### Links

- [Live Site URL:](https://fantastic-shortbread-1e555c.netlify.app/)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org) - React framework
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

Synchronizing the operation of the 2 filter inputs (region and individual country) proved to be more difficult than I was expecting.
There's still a minor bug with this in the project.  Used useRef and useEffect hooks to help with this - gained some experience with these.

### Continued development

Gain greater familiarity with the useEffect react hook
